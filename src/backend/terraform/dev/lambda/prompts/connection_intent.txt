Return **only** valid JSON that matches the schema provided below.  
• "score" = how strongly the text invites or seeks connection with others, from 0 to 1.  
• "confidence" = how certain *you* are in that score, from 0 to 1.  
Do **not** add any other keys or commentary.

Scoring rubric for CONNECTION_INTENT
0.90‑1.00 – Explicit, eager outreach; direct requests for engagement, shared experience, or support  
  ▪ "Has anyone else been through this? I'd really love to hear your stories."  
0.70‑0.89 – Clear desire for dialogue or resonance, though slightly hedged or polite  
  ▪ "I'm curious what you all think about this. Feel free to chime in."  
0.40‑0.69 – Mixed / some nod to an audience but mostly self‑focused narrative  
  ▪ "Just wondering aloud here. Thoughts welcome, I guess."  
0.10‑0.39 – Largely self‑contained update or rant / minimal invitation for response  
  ▪ "Here's what happened to me today, posting it so I remember."  
0.00‑0.09 – Zero connection intent; purely informational, directive, or detached  
  ▪ "Reminder: the meeting is at 3 PM."  

Confidence guidelines  
• > 0.85 when the text clearly lands in one rubric band.  
• 0.50‑0.85 when cues are mixed or brief.  
• < 0.50 when the excerpt is very short, contradictory, or off‑topic.
