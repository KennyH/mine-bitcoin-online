This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Setting up local environment

- Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the necessary credentials and secrets. You csan get these after deploying the terraform and logging into AWS Console for Cognito.

## Setting up remote environment

- You will need to set corresponding env variables (from `.env.local`) in your cloud environment (e.g., GitHub secrets).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
